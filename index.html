    <h2><strong>Planning Site for Website Project!</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>My Ideas</strong></p>
      <ul><strong>A website for students to take a short study break</strong></ul>
        <li>Funny videos</li>
        <li>Cute pictures of animals</li>
        <li>To mak sure they get back to work they can set timers that
           would automaticly close the website so they would get back to
           work.</li>
      <ul><strong>A sharing site for teacher</strong></ul>
        <li>Teachers from all around the world make accounts so they can
          help, get help, or meet other teachers with similar interests.</li>
        <li>It could let them organize events to meet teacchers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>My group</strong></p>
      <ul>Members:
        <li>Christian</li>
        <li>Miffy</li>
        <li>Shrijith</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Objective of the website is for the American International School's AP Physics B
        class to be able to go online and study and review the core topic of their class, Kinematics.</p>
      <ul><strong>Succes Criteria</strong>
        <li>make a flowchart each of the site layout</li>
        <li>pick the one that is best for the audiance</li>
        <li>add video and questions about kinematics</li>
        <li>hover effect over the links for the subpages</li>
        <li>logo with Mr. Lo on it</li>
        <li>link quiz for students to practice what they have learned</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My group decided to do a website for Mr.Lo's Physics B class, It would be
        helpful for reviewing and going through topics that they aren't so confident with.
        That was the orignal plan but Mr.Lo has something else in mind for us, instead of
        focunsing on four different topics he wants us to just stick to one topic, Kinematics.
        Right now we have faou flow charts that show us the basic idea of our four pages. Its
        going to be more lab focused then notes and lectures focused.</p>

      <p>Flowchart 1 (Shailee): this is the flowchart I made, it is very basic there will be a simple homage with just the title logo and three links connecting to the subpages (Video+lab, concept, and conclusion)
      </p>
        <div style="width: 480px; height: 360px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:480px; height:360px" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/e62e6488-5f78-4f5e-a9f7-aba21323d166" id="_U65EjaT_hA_"></iframe><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/mind_mapping_software" style="margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none; display: inline-block; position: absolute; bottom: 5px; left: 5px;"><img alt="mind mapping software"title="Lucidchart online diagrams"style="width: 100px; height: 30px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border-image: none; border: none; display: block"src="https://www.lucidchart.com/img/diagrams-lucidchart.png"/></a></div>
      <p>Flowchart 2 (Miffy): this is similar to the one I made but instead of having the video on the subpage its on the homepage. Also her subpages are a little different compared to mine, she has concept, application, conclusion.
      </p>
        <div style="width: 480px; height: 360px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:480px; height:360px" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/bda38ac9-a7cc-4894-9ec6-a78674bb2cc6" id="ZIt_~09Ov5G5"></iframe><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/mind_mapping_software" style="margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none; display: inline-block; position: absolute; bottom: 5px; left: 5px;"><img alt="mind mapping software"title="Lucidchart online diagrams"style="width: 100px; height: 30px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border-image: none; border: none; display: block"src="https://www.lucidchart.com/img/diagrams-lucidchart.png"/></a></div>
      <p>Flowchart 3 (Shrijith): instead of us all just trying the layout with one topic in mind Shrijith and Christian tried covering all the topics but in less detail with thetis. </p>
        <div style="width: 480px; height: 360px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:480px; height:360px" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/b587d64b-3b32-4cc4-8ed2-db3e429f3cc1" id="rRt_TOM.MKZs"></iframe><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/mind_mapping_software" style="margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none; display: inline-block; position: absolute; bottom: 5px; left: 5px;"><img alt="mind mapping software"title="Lucidchart online diagrams"style="width: 100px; height: 30px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border-image: none; border: none; display: block"src="https://www.lucidchart.com/img/diagrams-lucidchart.png"/></a></div>
      <p>Flowchart 4 (Christian): again instead of just focusing on one topic Christian covered all four topics with his subpages.</p>
      <p><strong>We are going with Miffy's flowchart!</strong>After dicussing which flow chart is the best for the convince of our audiacne
        and talking to Mr.Lo we decided to go with Miffy's flowchart.The one Shrijith and Christian did
         were covering to many topics and Mr.Lo said that he wanted to just focus on Kinnematics so we
        let go of their ideas. My flowchat was similar to Miffy's but Mr.Lo liked Miffy's order of how
        things were set up better, so at the end we decided to go with hers.</p>
