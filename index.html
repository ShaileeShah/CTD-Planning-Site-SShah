    <h2><strong>Planning Site for Website Project!</strong></h2>
      <p>My Ideas</p>
      <ul><strong>A website for students to take a short study break</strong></ul>
        <li>Funny videos</li>
        <li>Cute pictures of animals</li>
        <li>To mak sure they get back to work they can set timers that
           would automaticly close the website so they would get back to
           work.</li>
      <ul><strong>A sharing site for teacher</strong></ul>
        <li>Teachers from all around the world make accounts so they can
          help, get help, or meet other teachers with similar interests.</li>
        <li>It could let them organize events to meet teacchers.<li>
      </ul>
      <ul><strong>My group members</strong> 
        <li>Christian</li>
        <li>Miffy</li>
        <li>Shrijith</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><strong>Our Proposal</strong>
        <li>After discusing and taking a look at each other's ideas we decided
          to go with Shrijith proposal for the Physics B Mid-Term Review site.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul><strong>Client</strong>
        <li> Mr.Alan Lo is our client we are making this for his Physics B class's
          midterm, so if they want to practice or go back and look at some notes
          its clear for them.</li></ul>
      <ul><strong>Audiance</strong>
        <li> All the Physics B students and maybe the students who take the class
          next year if the content remains the same.</li> </ul>
      <ul><strong>Objectives</strong>
        <li>1. To help AP Physics B students who need extra practice for the midterm
          exam
            2. To help Mr. Lo have a useful platform where he can provide extra information
            or clear up topics that students may be confused on.
