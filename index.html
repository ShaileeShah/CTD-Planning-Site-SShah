    <h2><strong>Planning Site for Website Project!</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>My Ideas</strong></p>
      <ul><strong>A website for students to take a short study break</strong></ul>
        <li>Funny videos</li>
        <li>Cute pictures of animals</li>
        <li>To mak sure they get back to work they can set timers that
           would automaticly close the website so they would get back to
           work.</li>
      <ul><strong>A sharing site for teacher</strong></ul>
        <li>Teachers from all around the world make accounts so they can
          help, get help, or meet other teachers with similar interests.</li>
        <li>It could let them organize events to meet teacchers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>My group</strong></p>
      <ul><strong>Members</strong>
        <li>Christian</li>
        <li>Miffy</li>
        <li>Shrijith</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My group decided to do a website for Mr.Lo's Physics B class, It would be
        helpful for reviewing and going through topics that they aren't so confident with.
        That was the orignal plan but Mr.Lo has something else in mind for us, instead of
        focunsing on four different topics he wants us to just stick to one topic, Kinematics.
        Right now we have a flow chart that shows us the most basic idea of our four pages. Its
        going to be more lab focused then notes and lectures focused.</p>
