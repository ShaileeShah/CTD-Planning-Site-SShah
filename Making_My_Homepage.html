      <strong>The benefits of using fireworks</strong>
      <li>Making the actual layout is easy since you use boxs and images</li>
      <li>Adding links is easy since they have their own tool for that</li>
      <li>Doesn't really involve CSS just design with their tools</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Making my Hompage in two different Programs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="htmldocs/Index_FW.html">Fireworks Edition<a/></li>
    <li><a href="htmldocs/Index_DW.html">Dreamweaver Edition</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>After trying both Fireworks and Dreamweaver to make a sample homepage, I
    found using fireworks alot easier because it is a easier and faster process.
    Whereas for me using Dreamweaver was a haphazard beacuse it was designing while
    coding wjich threw me of.</p>
