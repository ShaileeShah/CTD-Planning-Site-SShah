  <h3>Creating Buttons in Fireworks</h3>
  <p>Making buttons in fireworks was fairly easy,
     we started with making a simple box and adding
     text in that box. Then we converted that box
     into a button symbol making it like a template
     to make further boxes. From there I just added
     theses template gave them a few different command
    for hover and click and I was ready with my buttons 
    template.
