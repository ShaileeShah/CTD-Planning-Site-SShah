  <h3>Creating Buttons in Fireworks</h3>
  <p>Making buttons in fireworks was fairly easy,
     we started with making a simple box and adding
     text in that box. Then we converted that box
     into a button symbol making it like a template
     to make more boxes. From there I just added
     copies of the template and gave them a few different
     commands for when the mouse hovers and clicks. Then since it
     was a template they all had the same text which I changed
     by simply adding what I wanted in the external CSS text box.
     The whole process was really quick and fast.
